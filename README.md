### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my repositories.

It is such an honor your visit. 

I am an Economist being introduced (by my self) to Web Development World. 

I am currently studying Object Oriented Programming and Web Development in Platzi. :green_heart:

You can ask me about Economics and Data Science applied to Economics. In Economics I usually work on International Economics and Applied Microeconomics projects.
